# Climate Change Sentiment Analysis
e a description on this code 
ChatGPT
This code performs sentiment analysis on textual data using a Random Forest Classifier. Here is a description of the code:

Data Preprocessing:

The code reads the training data from a CSV file and the test data from another CSV file.
URLs in the messages are replaced with a placeholder string.
Punctuation marks are removed from the messages, and the text is converted to lowercase.
Tokenization is performed to split the messages into individual words.
Stemming is applied to reduce words to their root form.
Lemmatization is used to convert words to their base form.
Stopwords (common words with little significance) are removed from the messages.
Feature Extraction:

The messages are represented as feature vectors using the CountVectorizer.
The CountVectorizer converts the text into a matrix of token counts, where each row represents a message and each column represents a unique word in the corpus.
The maximum number of features is limited to 1000, and English stopwords are excluded.
Feature Scaling:

The feature vectors are transformed using the StandardScaler to normalize their values.
The StandardScaler scales the feature vectors to have zero mean and unit variance.
Model Training:

The dataset is split into training and validation sets using train_test_split.
A Random Forest Classifier is instantiated.
The Random Forest Classifier is trained on the training set.
Model Evaluation:

The trained model is used to make predictions on the validation set.
The accuracy of the predictions is evaluated to assess the performance of the model.
Prediction on Test Data:

The messages from the test dataset are transformed into feature vectors using the CountVectorizer fitted on the training data.
The transformed test data is used to make predictions using the trained Random Forest Classifier.
Output:

The predicted sentiments (positive or negative) for the test data are saved in a CSV file along with their respective tweet IDs.
This code provides a basic pipeline for sentiment analysis, including data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and prediction.
